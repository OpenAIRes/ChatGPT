# ChatGPT Repository

This repository contains a simple example project demonstrating how to integrate a chatbot using OpenAI's API. The goal of this repository is to provide a basic starting point for experimenting with ChatGPT-like functionality in your own projects.

## Goals

- Showcase how to send prompts to OpenAI's API and process responses.
- Provide example code that can be extended into a full-featured chatbot.
- Document setup steps and usage instructions.

## Directory Structure

- `src/` - application source code
- `tests/` - unit tests
- `docs/` - project documentation

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies with `pip install openai`.
2. Set your API key in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. Run the example script to interact with the chatbot: `python -m src.chatbot`.
